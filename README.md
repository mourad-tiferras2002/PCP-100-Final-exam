# Problem 1: Variables and Data Types
Write a Python program that declares two variables: one to store your favorite number and another
to store your favorite string (e.g., your name). Print both variables in a sentence like "My favorite
number is [number] and my favorite string is [string]."
# Problem 2: Basic Input/Output
Create a Python script that asks the user to enter their age and then prints whether they are a
teenager (ages 13-19) or not. Make sure to convert the input string to an integer before performing
the check.
# Problem 3: Control Structures
Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers (for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) and prints out each
number multiplied by 10. Use a for loop to iterate through the list.
# Problem 4: Functions
Define a Python function named max_number that takes three integers as arguments and returns
the largest of the three. Include a docstring for the function, and demonstrate how to call this
function with example arguments.
# Problem 5: Error Handling
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a divisor and divides the number 100 by the
entered divisor. Use try-except blocks to handle the case where the divisor is zero, printing an error
message like "Division by zero is not allowed." Additionally, handle any other possible exceptions by
printing a generic error message
